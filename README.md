# Robot Gladiators

### Description
This front-end web application is a (MVP) robot fighting type game that is played through web alerts. During the game, players will coach their robot through a series of fightsâ€”gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way. The robot that survives with the most cash will be remembered in the browser's storage system.
